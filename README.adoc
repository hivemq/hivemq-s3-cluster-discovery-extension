== S3 Cluster Discovery Extension

*Type*: Cluster Discovery

*Version*: 4.0.0

*License*: Apache License Version 2.0


=== Purpose

This extension allows your HiveMQ cluster nodes to discover each other dynamically by exchanging their information via S3 from Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Each node will place its own ip-address and port to the given bucket and will read the files from other nodes.
The ip-address and port are taken from the `external-address` and `external-port` which is configured in the cluster `transport` (config.xml).
If they are not set, the `bind-address` and `bind-port` will be used.
The extension will regularly check the configured S3 bucket for files from other HiveMQ nodes, which contains the information on how to connect to them.
Additionally every broker updates its own file on a regular basis to prevent the file from expiring.
The `s3discovery.properties` can be reloaded during runtime.


=== Installation

//FIXME Add missing links

* Download the extension from the HiveMQ website.
* Copy the content of the zip file to the `extensions` folder of your HiveMQ nodes.
* Modify the `s3discovery.properties` file for your needs.
* Change the discovery mechanism of HiveMQ to `extension`.


=== Configuration

==== General Configuration

|===
| Config name           | Required  | Description
| s3-bucket-name        |     x     | Name of the S3 bucket to use.
| s3-bucket-region      |     x     | The region in which this S3 bucket resides. (List of regions: {s3_regions}[AWS documentation])
| file-prefix           |     x     | Prefix for the filename of every node's file.
| file-expiration       |     x     | Timeout in seconds after a file on S3 will be removed.
| update-interval       |     x     | Interval in seconds in which the own information will be updated. (Must be smaller than `file-expiration`)
| s3-endpoint           |           | Endpoint url to use other S3 compatible storage services.
| s3-endpoint-region    |           | The region of the endpoint. (Optional)
| s3-path-style-access  |           | De-/activate path style access. Information about path style access can be found in the {path-style-access}[AWS documentation].

update-interval:180
credentials-type:default

==== Authentication Configuration
The extension uses AWS API operations for exchanging cluster information.
These operations work with `Access Keys`, if you don't know what access keys are or how to generate them please look at the official {aws_credentials}[AWS documentation] about credentials.

===== Default Authentication

Default Authentication tries to access S3 via the default mechanisms in the following order:

1. Environment variables
2. Java system properties
3. User credentials file
4. IAM profiles assigned to EC2 instance

.Example Default Config
[source]
----
credentials-type:default
----

===== Environment Variables Authentication

Uses environment variables to specify your AWS credentials the following variables need to be set:

* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
* AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

.Linux example
[source,bash]
----
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key>
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-key>
----

.Example Environment Variables Config
[source]
----
credentials-type:environment_variables
----

===== Java System Property Authentication

Uses Java system properties to specify your AWS credentials the following Java system properties need to be set:

* aws.accessKeyId
* aws.secretKey

.Example Java System Properties Config
[source]
----
credentials-type:java_system_properties
----

You can for example extend the `run.sh` or `run.bat` in order to start HiveMQ with the system properties:

.Example for extendending `run.sh`
[source]
----
############## VARIABLES
JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Daws.accessKeyId=<your-access-key> -Daws.secretKey=<your-secret-key>"
----

===== User Credentials Authentication

Uses the credentials file which can be created by calling 'aws configure' (AWS CLI).
This file is usually located at ~/.aws/credentials. The exact location can vary based on the platform.
The location of the file can be configured by setting the environment variable `AWS_CREDENTIAL_PROFILE_FILE` to the location of your file.

.Example Java System Properties Config
[source]
----
credentials-type:user_credentials_file
----

===== Instance Profile Credentials Authentication

Uses the IAM Roles assigned to the EC2 instance running HiveMQ to access S3.

WARNING: This only works if HiveMQ is running on an EC2 instance and your EC2 instance has configured the right IAM Role to access S3!


.Example Instance Profile Credentials Config
[source]
----
credentials-type:instance_profile_credentials
----

===== Access Key Authentication

Uses the credentials specified in the `s3discovery.properties` file.

The variables you must provide are:

* `credentials-access-key-id`
* `credentials-secret-access-key`

.Example Instance Profile Credentials Config
[source]
----
credentials-type:access_key
credentials-access-key-id:<your-access-key>
credentials-secret-access-key:<your-secret_access_key>
----

===== Secret Access Key Authentication

Uses the credentials specified in `s3discovery.properties` file to authenticate with a temporary session.

The variables you must provide are:

* `credentials-access-key-id`
* `credentials-secret-access-key`
* `credentials-session-token`

.Example Instance Profile Credentials Config
[source]
----
credentials-type:temporary_session
credentials-access-key-id:<your-access_key_id>
credentials-secret-access-key:<your-secret_access_key>
credentials-session-token:<your-session_token>
----


=== First Steps

* Create a S3 bucket with the configured name.
* Verify that the given authentication can access the S3 bucket.
* Start HiveMQ which will start discover other nodes via S3.
